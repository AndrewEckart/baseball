Big League Baseball
==========

This is a amateur Python program designed to scrape tables from Baseball-Reference.com and then use the resulting data to make fantasy baseball projections. The scraper is adapted from a module written by Andrew Lim.

Consider this program to be one part useful fantasy baseball tool, two parts Python learning exercise for the creator. The methods have not been optimized for performance or configured to accept more general input. Longer term goals include implementation of actual projection systems, asynchronous HTTP requests, and support for more options.

All data is property of Sports Reference LLC. SR terms of use do not support web crawling, so please use responsibly. If there is considerable usage of the scraper module to abuse B-R, I will consider attempting to implement a database using data from Retrosheet.
